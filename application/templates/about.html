            <p class="about"> Traditionally, data collection, such as mapping the sea floor (bathymetry) or measuring water properties 
                (e.g., salinity, temperature, pH), has been done manually using expensive and sophisticated equipment on vessels. 
                This approach is <b class="about">slow, costly, inefficient, and often hinders scientific progress.</b>
                It should also be recognized that one of the most common methods is to use divers, which inherently <b class="about">risk</b> 
                their <b class="about">lives during expeditions.</b> In addition, some areas are inaccessible by boat, 
                either due to legal restrictions or physical limitations, making it <b class="about">difficult to collect the necessary data.</b>

                <b class="about">an efficient, safer alternative</b>  to traditional methods. 
                AUVs can <b class="about">autonomously navigate and collect data in areas that are difficult or dangerous for divers to access</b>. 
                Equipped with advanced sensors, they gather accurate measurements of seafloor topography and water conditions without the need 
                for constant human involvement. This technology <b class="about">reduces the cost and time associated with research expeditions</b>, 
                while also minimizing risks to human life. As a result, AUVs streamline data collection, 
                making marine research <b class="about">more accessible and sustainable</b>.

            <a class="about" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-carde%C3%B1a-sanchez-448803131/">Professor Samuel Cardeña Sánchez</a>
            <br><b>Assistant Professor at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, Ponce Campus.</b><br>
            Currently, he is in charge of the Marine Robotics Laboratory as well as the Physics and Mathematics courses.<br>
            The professor's lines of research focus mainly on water quality studies, underwater inspections and issues related to the effects 
            of global warming on the marine environment, using remotely operated robots (ROV), multiple sensors and satellite images.
            In addition, there are collaboration agreements with the Port Authority of Ponce and the Punta Cucharas Nature Reserve.<br>

        <i>"The current challenge is focused on the design and construction of an autonomous marine robot (AUV), a surface vehicle programmed 
        to sweep aquatic areas of interest, equipped with an echo sounder and GPS capable of measuring localized depth that allows bathymetric 
        recording to model the relief of the seabed. Among the many advantages of this project are its versatility, functionality and low cost."</i>
